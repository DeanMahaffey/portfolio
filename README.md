# portfolio

This project is a portfolio website to show off some of the projects I will be working and creating. 
I build this portfolio with only HTML and CSS to start showcasing someof my works.
From this project that I learned was that CSS is complecatied and sometimes it can be easy. 
What I learned is that it takes decation to create and build a website, it just doesn't over night.
