# portfolio

This project is a portfolio website to show off some of the projects I will be working on and creating. I build this portfolio with only HTML and CSS to start showcasing some of my works. From this project, I learned that CSS is complicated, and sometimes it can be easy. I knew that it takes dedication to create and build a website; it just doesn't happen overnight.
